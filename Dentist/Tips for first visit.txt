I took Graham, 2.3 years old) to his first dentist appointment this morning, and there are 4 things I wish I had practiced with him prior to the visit. Thought I'd share it with the fam.

Practice playing dentist with:

1. wearing a face mask. Also, maybe even have your kid try wearing one.

2. wearing blue gloves.

3. your kid laying down on a bed.

4. use a lamp or flashlight to look into their mouth.

I thought we were prepared with playing dentist (we practiced opening wide, looking in, brushing, talked about the mirror tool), but these four other things really scared Graham. Overall, it went pretty well, but I wish I could have prepared him for these things, cause it probably could have gone down without the crying and kicking for freedom.
